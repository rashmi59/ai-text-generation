AI based text recommendations have become increasingly common in online text editors. In this paper we examined the effect of these text recommendations on the content of Airbnb host profiles. Using previously annotated datasets coded with 8 different categories, we fine-tuned two GPT-2 models on category specific Airbnb profile sentences. Using a text editor that we built, we conducted a study where these models generated suggestions for participants as they typed their Airbnb host profiles. We analyzed the sentences in the resulting profiles to evaluate the effect of the model suggestions and whether a nudging effect, in terms of content, was present. Our results found no significant effect on the content produced by the participants based on the category of data the model was fine-tuned with.
